WORKSPACE RESULTS CARDS - IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
=================================================

WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED:
--------------------
1. **Workspace Container Enhancement**
   - Replaced placeholder markdown with dynamic results container
   - Added header showing count of results
   - Container auto-scrolls with max 400px height

2. **Result Cards**
   - Each query creates a new card in workspace
   - Card title: "📊 Query @ HH:MM:SS - X rows × Y columns"
   - Cards start EXPANDED for immediate viewing
   - Collapsible by clicking card header
   - Full table with ALL columns shown inside

3. **Button Behavior**
   - Chat shows truncated table (5 cols + View)
   - Button: "📊 View Full Table in Workspace"
   - Click → Adds card to workspace
   - Button changes to "✓ Added to Workspace" (disabled)
   - Workspace auto-expands from collapsed state

4. **Auto-Management**
   - Keeps last 10 results (auto-removes oldest)
   - Header updates: "Query Results (3)" dynamically
   - Cards are collapsible to save space

UX FLOW:
--------
User: "query file abc: df.head(10)"
  ↓
Chat Response: Shows truncated table (5 cols)
               + "Showing 5 of 14 columns" hint
               + [📊 View Full Table in Workspace] button
  ↓
User clicks button
  ↓
Workspace: - Auto-expands if collapsed
           - New card appears at bottom
           - Card shows FULL table with all 14 columns
           - View links are clickable
           - User can collapse/expand card
  ↓
User continues querying
  ↓
Multiple cards stack in workspace
Each query gets its own card with timestamp


FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
-------------------
- Add close [×] button to individual cards
- Export table to CSV from card
- Pin important results (don't auto-remove)
- Add plot cards for matplotlib figures
- Search/filter within workspace results
