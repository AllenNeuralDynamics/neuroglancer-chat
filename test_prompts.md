what are the unique values in cluster_labels column?

can you give me all the Pvalb clusters?


## plotting
- sample 20 cells and scatter log_volume vs elongation



## Add annotation from query
Can you get the top log_volume in each cluster_label. include spatial coordinates. Then make a new annotation layer with a point for each cell. Call the layer "Clusters". Make it Green.
